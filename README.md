# uiohook-napi-32
This package only supports Windows 32-bit, and packages that can be paired with the uiohook n API in the project can be installed according to the platform. The usage is the same as uiohook-napi64 bit, and the current 32-bit version is 1.5.2 of 64 bit (本包只支持window 32位的，项目中可以搭配uiohook-napi 的包根据平台判断安装。用法与uiohook-napi 64位一样,当前32位的版本是64位的1.5.2)
